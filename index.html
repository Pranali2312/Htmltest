					        <p>The US brokerage ecosystem recommends that every investor account should have insurance. Every customer is protected by Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”) which currently protects the securities and cash in your aAccount up to USD 500,000, of which up to USD 250,000 may be in cash and up to USD 250,000 in stocks.Please note that this protection of up to USD 500,000 is not applicable on general losses in the stock market.</p>
					        <p>SIPC says the following: SIPC protects against the loss of cash and securities – such as stocks and bonds – – held by a customer at a financially-troubled SIPC-member brokerage firm. The limit of SIPC protection is USD $500,000, which includes a $USD 250,000 limit for cash. A non-U.S. citizen with an account at a brokerage firm that is a member of SIPC is treated the same as a resident or citizen of the United States with an account at a brokerage firm that is a member of SIPC.</p>
					        <p>SIPC does not protect against the decline in value of your securities. SIPC does not protect individuals who are sold worthless stocks and other securities. SIPC does not protect claims against a broker for bad investment advice, or for recommending inappropriate investments.

							        <p>Currently, you can invest up to USD 250,000 every year in foreign stocks from India. This amount can change, subject to RBI guidelines. So, for now, your investments in U.S. securities are also governed by the same limit.</p>
							        <p>Foreign investments fall under clearly defined RBI guidelines. The remittance of money for foreign investments comes under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS).</p>
							        <p>Under LRS, an individual can remit up to USD 250,000 per financial year to invest in foreign equities through an authorized dealer (commonly, your bank). As per RBI policy, having a PAN card is required to purchase shares in foreign countries.</p>

						      <div class="card-body">
						        <p>There is no Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) for your stock market gains in the U.S.. So when you make money and send it back to your Indian bank account, the broker in the US does not deduct any tax on it. You will have to pay Short-term Capital Gains Tax or  Long-term Capital Gains Tax in India, whatever is applicable. Short-term Capital Gains apply if a security is held for less than 12 months.</p>
						        <p>A 25% TDS applies only on your dividend earnings. This is when stocks in your portfolio give out dividends to their investors.</p>
						        <p>U.S. and India have a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA). This means that you pay tax only once. For the TDS on your dividend earnings, you will get W-8BEN form. You can use it while filing your taxes in India to show that you have already paid taxes on this income. W-8BEN can be issued at your request. For any further queries and help understanding taxation, please feel free to raise a query and we will get back to you with an expert opinion. </p>
